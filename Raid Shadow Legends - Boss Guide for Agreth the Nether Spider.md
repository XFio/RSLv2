### **Raid Shadow Legends - Boss Guide for Agreth the Nether Spider**

#### **I. Overview**

Agreth the Nether Spider is a boss in the Doom Tower (Rotations 1 and 2). Her primary mechanic is inflicting large amounts of **unblockable and unresistable Poison debuffs** on the player's champions. These poisons are detonated (activated at once) when Agreth takes her turn, causing massive damage. She is accompanied by four Nether Spiderlings who have a **Counterattack** buff. Attacking the spiderlings triggers a counterattack that also **heals Agreth**.

#### **II. Core Mechanics Summary**

*   **Unavoidable Poisons:** Agreth and her Spiderlings apply 5% Poison debuffs that cannot be blocked or resisted.
*   **Poison Detonation:** At the start of her turn, Agreth's "Tide of Toxins" passive deals instant damage from all Poison debuffs on your champions.
*   **Spiderling Counterattack & Heal:** Spiderlings are spawned with a Counterattack buff. Attacking them causes them to retaliate and heal Agreth for 10% of her MAX HP per hit.
*   **Punishes Turn Meter Reduction:** Decreasing Agreth's Turn Meter triggers her "Elder Lurker" passive, causing her to counterattack for high, defense-ignoring damage.
*   **Punishes AoE Attacks:** Using Area of Effect (AoE) attacks will trigger all spiderlings to counterattack, resulting in significant healing for the boss and damage to your team.

#### **V. Strategy Guide**

**A. Stat Requirements:**
*   **Accuracy:** Approximately **100 ACC** for Doom Tower Normal and **330 ACC** for Doom Tower Hard is needed to land your own debuffs (like HP Burn or Stun).
*   **Resistance:** Useless for this fight, as the boss's Poison debuffs cannot be resisted. Focus on HP, Defense, and Speed instead.

**B. What to AVOID:**
1.  **Champions with AoE on their A1 (Default Skill):** These champions will constantly trigger the spiderlings' counterattacks, healing the boss. It is recommended to disable AoE skills in the Team AI Preset if they are not on a champion's A1.
2.  **Turn Meter Reduction Skills:** Using these skills will trigger a powerful, defense-ignoring counterattack from Agreth that can one-shot most champions.

**C. Offensive Strategy (How to Defeat):**
*   **Primary Method (Boss):** Use **HP Burn** and **Poison** debuffs. These deal damage based on the boss's MAX HP, making them highly effective. The Offense Masteries "Warmaster" and "Giant Slayer" are also effective.
*   **Primary Method (Spiderlings):**
    *   **Crowd Control:** Use champions with reliable **Stun** or **Freeze** debuffs to prevent the spiderlings from counterattacking.
    *   **Passive Damage:** Use champions who apply debuffs passively (e.g., Dre
