### **Raid Shadow Legends - Astranyx the Dark Fae Boss Guide**

#### **1. Overview and Core Mechanic**

Astranyx the Dark Fae is a boss in the Doom Tower (Rotation 3) of Raid: Shadow Legends. Her unique and primary mechanic is the ability to banish a player's champions and create hostile "mirror copies" of them. To retrieve a banished champion, the player must defeat its corresponding mirror copy. The boss's abilities and effectiveness are also influenced by the affinities (Magic, Force, Spirit, Void) of the player's champions.

#### **4. Strategy Guide**

**4.1. General Principle**
The core challenge is that your team's strengths become the boss's strengths via the mirror copies. Therefore, a successful team must be able to quickly defeat its own copies before focusing on the boss.

**4.2. How to Defeat the Mirror Copies**
The copies are as squishy or tanky as your own champions. The goal is to build your team squishy enough to be killed easily by your own damage dealer.

*   **Method 1: AoE (Area of Effect) Nuker:**
    *   **Concept:** Use a high-damage AoE champion (like one from an arena team) to wipe out all the copies in one shot.
    *   **Challenge:** Requires careful planning or multiple nukers to ensure the main AoE skill is not on cooldown when you reach the boss wave.

*   **Method 2: Extra Turn Single-Target Nuker:**
    *   **Concept:** Use a champion who gains an extra turn upon killing an enemy (e.g., Relickeeper, Hurndig). Set their AI to only use their A1 (default attack). They kill one copy, gain a turn, kill the next, and so on, creating a chain reaction.
    *   **Advantage:** Highly consistent for auto-farming as it doesn't rely on cooldowns.
    *   **Caution:** The nuker's affinity must not be weak against any of your other champions, or a "weak hit" will break the kill chain.

**4.3. How to Defeat Astranyx (The Boss)**
Once the copies are defeated, focus on the boss.

*   **Primary Strategy: Turn Meter Control:**
    *   **Concept:** The most effective method is to prevent her from ever taking a turn. Use champions with strong [Decrease Turn Meter] skills.
    *   **Key Champions:** Lyssandra, Alure, Armiger.
    *   **Supporting Debuff:** A [Decrease Speed] debuff is also highly effective.
    *   **Note:** Remember her passive reduces Turn Meter effects by 50%, so you need consistent application.

*   **Secondary Strategy: Brute Force / Damage:**
    *   **Concept:** If you lack top-tier turn meter control, you must out-damage her while surviving her attacks.
    *   **Counters for her mechanics:**
        *   To counter the **Fear** debuff (from using Void champions), bring a debuff cleanser like Doompriest or a passive cleanser like Inquisitor Shamael.
        *   To counter her **Healing** (from using Spirit champions), bring a champion who can apply a [Heal Reduction] debuff.
    *   **What to Avoid:** Do not bring tanky, high-resist teams with revive skills. This makes it extremely difficult to kill your own mirror copies, which allows the boss time to banish your champions one by one.
