# Raid Shadow Legends - Spider's Den Dungeon Guide

## 1. Overview of the Spider's Den

The Spider's Den is a dungeon in Raid: Shadow Legends featuring the boss Skavag, the Spider Queen. The primary mechanic involves managing a horde of Spiderlings that the boss summons.

### Key Mechanics:
- **Spiderling Summons:** Skavag summons 2 Spiderlings whenever a champion takes a turn or gets an extra turn, up to a maximum of 10 Spiderlings.
- **Poison Debuffs:** Spiderlings inflict 5% Poison debuffs. Multiple stacks can quickly defeat even high-HP champions.
- **Boss Healing and Damage Increase:** Skavag consumes her Spiderlings to heal herself to full health and permanently increase her own damage. This makes longer fights progressively harder.

### Difficulties:
- **Normal Mode:** The boss is named Skavag.
- **Hard Mode:** The boss is named Tainted Skavag. This mode can drop Mythical rarity artifacts.

### Farmable Accessories:
- Ring
- Amulet
- Banner

## 2. Normal Mode: Skavag (The Spider Queen)

### 2.1. Skavag's Skills

*   **Venom Spray [ATK]:** Attacks all enemies. Damage increases by 15% if the target has [Poison] debuffs.
*   **Enfeeble [ATK] (Cooldown: 4 turns):** Attacks all enemies. Has a 70% chance of decreasing the Turn Meter by 30%. If a target’s Turn Meter is fully depleted, places a [Sleep] debuff for 1 turn.
*   **Spiderling Horde (Cooldown: 2 turns):** Spawns 6 Spiderlings at the start of the round, 2 at the start of each enemy Champion’s turn, and 4 at the end of her own turn (max 10). She consumes all Spiderlings at the start of her turn, healing 3% of her MAX HP and permanently increasing her ATK by 10% for each one consumed. She will not consume them on consecutive turns.
*   **Healing Limitation:** Heals from Lifesteal Artifacts and skills based on damage inflicted are reduced to 35% of their normal value against Skavag and her Spiderlings.
*   **Healing Assured (Passive):** Immune to [Heal Reduction] debuffs.
*   **Almighty Immunity (Passive):** Immune to [Stun], [Freeze], [Sleep], [Provoke], [Block Active Skills], [Fear], and [True Fear]. Also immune to HP exchange, HP balancing, and cooldown increasing effects.
*   **Almighty Strength (Passive, Stages 21-25):** Damage from skills that scale based on enemy MAX HP cannot exceed 10% of the Boss’ MAX HP.
*   **Almighty Persistence (Passive, Stages 21-25):** All Turn Meter reduction effects are decreased by 50%.

### 2.2. Key Stats: Accuracy and Resistance

*   **Accuracy Needed:** To reliably land debuffs on Stage 20, you need approximately 225 Accuracy. A general formula is `Dungeon Stage x 11` or `Boss Resist + 25`.
*   **Resistance Needed:** To resist debuffs from the Spiderlings on Stage 20, you need approximately 300 Resistance. A general formula is `Boss Accuracy + 100`.

### 2.3. Offensive Strategies to Defeat Skavag

*   **Strategy 1: Basic AoE Nuke (Stages 1-14):** Use champions with strong Area of Effect (AoE) damage skills to kill the Spiderlings before they can act. Pair them with an AoE [Decrease Defense] champion like Warmaiden or Stag Knight.
*   **Strategy 2: Enemy MAX HP Nuke (Stages 15-20):** As Spiderlings get tankier, use champions with skills that deal damage based on the enemy's MAX HP. Key champions include Coldheart, Royal Guard, and Husk. Pair them with [Decrease Defense] and [Weaken] debuffs.
*   **Strategy 3: Poison Explosion:** Use champions like Zavia or Elenaril to detonate [Poison] debuffs for massive damage. This requires an AoE poisoner (e.g., Bad-el-Kazar) and potentially a debuff extender. This strategy ignores enemy defense.
*   **Strategy 4: AoE HP Burn (Stages 21-25):** Since Enemy MAX HP damage is capped on higher stages, AoE [HP Burn] becomes the most effective strategy. The burn damage from all the Spiderlings taking a turn will quickly burn down the main boss.
*   **Strategy 5: Turn Meter Control:** Use champions like Lyssandra, Coldheart, or Armiger to consistently reduce the boss's Turn Meter, preventing her from taking a turn to heal or attack. This is often combined with other damage strategies.
*   **Support Strategy: Skill Cooldown Reset:** Use champions like Renegade or Prince Kymar to reset the cooldowns of your key damage dealers, allowing for more frequent use of powerful skills.

### 2.4. Defensive Strategies to Survive Skavag

*   **Strategy 1: AoE Shield:** Use champions like Miscreated Monster or Valkyrie to place large shields on your team, absorbing the damage and poison from the Spiderlings.
*   **Strategy 2: Crowd Control:** Use AoE [Stun] or [Freeze] champions (e.g., Miscreated Monster, Scyl of the Drakes) to prevent the Spiderlings from attacking.
*   **Strategy 3: High Resist Tank/Bait:** Use a champion of a weak affinity to the Spiderlings. Build them with high resistance, a Lifesteal set, and the Warmaster mastery. The Spiderlings will target this champion, who can then heal back by counter-attacking. Sinesha is a classic example.

### 2.5. Skavag's Affinity by Stage

The boss's affinity rotates through the stages:
*   **Void:** Stages 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21
*   **Magic:** Stages 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, 25
*   **Force:** Stages 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 23
*   **Spirit:** Stages 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24

## 3. Hard Mode: Tainted Skavag

### 3.1. Tainted Skavag's Skills

*   **Caustic Webbing:** Attacks all enemies. Damage increases by 15% if the target is under [Poison] debuffs.
*   **Torpefy (Cooldown: 4 turns):** Attacks all enemies. Decreases Turn Meter by 30%. If a target’s Turn Meter is fully depleted, places a [Sleep] debuff for 1 turn which cannot be resisted.
*   **Tainted Brood (Passive):** Same summoning mechanic as Normal Mode.
*   **Tainted Immunity (Passive):** Immune to [Heal Reduction], [Decrease SPD], and [HP Burn] debuffs, as well as Turn Meter reduction effects.
*   **HP Burn Interaction:** When an [HP Burn] debuff activates on a Tainted Spiderling, Tainted Skavag *heals* for 1% of her MAX HP.
*   **Spiderling Death Damage:** Whenever a Tainted Spiderling dies, Tainted Skavag takes damage equal to 3% of her MAX HP.
*   **Awakened Weakness (Passive):** The boss deals less damage to and takes more damage from champions with higher Awakening levels.
*   **Almighty Strength (Passive):** Damage from skills that scale based on enemy MAX HP cannot exceed 10% of the Boss’ MAX HP.

### 3.2. Strategy Guide for Tainted Skavag

The strategy for Hard Mode is completely different from Normal Mode due to the boss's immunities.

*   **Primary Damage Source:** The main way to damage Tainted Skavag is by killing her Tainted Spiderlings. Each death inflicts 3% of her MAX HP as damage. Killing all 10 Spiderlings at once deals 30% of her health.
*   **Avoid HP Burn:** Do NOT use [HP Burn] champions, as this will heal the boss.
*   **Team Composition:**
    *   **AoE Nukers:** The core of the team should be powerful AoE damage dealers (e.g., Sinesha, Skullcrown, Acrizia) to kill the Spiderlings.
    *   **Support Buffs:** Bring champions who can place [Increase ATK] and [Increase C. DMG] on your nukers.
    *   **Support Debuffs:** Bring champions who can place AoE [Decrease DEF] and [Weaken] on the Spiderlings to ensure they can be killed in one hit.
    *   **Survivability:** Use champions that provide [Increase DEF] and [Shield] buffs to survive the onslaught. Artifact sets like Bolster and Defiant are valuable.
    *   **Turn Meter Control:** While you cannot control the boss's Turn Meter, you should boost your own team's Turn Meter and decrease the Turn Meter of the Tainted Spiderlings.
