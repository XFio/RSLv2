### **Raid Shadow Legends - Sand Devil's Necropolis Guide**

**1. Overview**

The Sand Devil's Necropolis is an end-game dungeon in Raid Shadow Legends, released in December 2022. Its primary purpose is for players to farm Oil (Lesser, Greater, and Superior) and Chaos Dust, which are used to ascend artifacts and accessories.

The boss of the dungeon is named Al-Naemeh. The core mechanic of the fight is the "Slumber" state. Players must apply a [Sleep] debuff to the boss to make him vulnerable. While asleep, the boss can receive other debuffs and takes increased damage. However, unlike the Fire Knight, the boss will awaken after receiving a specific number of hits.

**3. Boss Details: Al-Naemeh, the Sand Devil**

**Skills:**

*   **A1 - Rage of the Sands:** Attacks all enemies. Places a 30% [Decrease SPD] debuff and a 50% [Decrease ACC] debuff on all enemies for 2 turns.
*   **A2 - Dune Tempest:** Removes all debuffs from himself, then heals. The amount healed is proportional to the total amount of destroyed MAX HP on the enemy team. After healing, he attacks all enemies. The damage this skill inflicts decreases for each debuff that was removed.
*   **A3 - Feasting Swarm:** Attacks all enemies. This attack ignores [Shield], [Block Damage], and [Unkillable] buffs, as well as 100% of the targetâ€™s DEF. After attacking, places a [Sleep] debuff on himself for 2 turns.
    *   **Passive Effect:** The cooldown of this skill is increased by 1 turn whenever a [Sleep] debuff is placed on him by an enemy champion.

**Passive Skills:**

*   **Rest of the Wicked (Passive):**
    *   **While Awake:** Al-Naemeh is immune to all debuffs except [Sleep]. He is also immune to HP exchange/balancing, cooldown increases, Turn Meter reduction, and debuff duration increases.
    *   **While Asleep:** Al-Naemeh is only immune to [Stun], [Freeze], [Provoke], [Block Active/Passive Skills], [Fear], [True Fear], [Petrification], HP exchange/balancing, and cooldown increases.
    *   **Damage Reduction:** He has an innate damage reduction that scales with the stage level. This reduction is decreased by 15% for each debuff he is currently under.
        *   Stages 1-5: 25% damage reduction
        *   Stages 6-15: 50% damage reduction
        *   Stages 16-25: 75% damage reduction

*   **Soul Sustenance (Passive):**
    *   Whenever Al-Naemeh attacks, he destroys the MAX HP of all targets by 5%.
    *   If an enemy decreases his Turn Meter, he destroys that enemy's MAX HP by the same percentage.
    *   If an enemy champion is healed while Al-Naemeh is under a [Sleep] debuff, a portion of that champion's destroyed MAX HP is restored equal to the value of the heal.

*   **Dreamless Sleep (Passive):**
    *   This passive activates a "Slumber" counter when a [Sleep] debuff is placed on Al-Naemeh.
    *   The [Sleep] debuff is not removed when he is attacked.
    *   The Slumber counter decreases by 1 each time Al-Naemeh is hit (excluding damage from debuffs like Poison or HP Burn).
    *   When the counter reaches 0, the [Sleep] debuff is removed, and his Turn Meter is filled by 50%.
    *   After a [Sleep] debuff expires or is removed, he becomes immune to [Sleep] for 1 turn.
    *   **Slumber Counter Duration (Dungeon):**
        *   Stages 1-5: 16 hits
        *   Stages 6-10: 14 hits
        *   Stages 11-15: 12 hits
        *   Stages 16-20: 10 hits
        *   Stages 21-25: 8 hits
    *   **Slumber Counter Duration (Cursed City):**
        *   Normal Difficulty: 10 hits
        *   Hard Difficulty: 8 hits

**4. Strategy to Defeat the Sand Devil**

*   **Core Mechanic:** Bring a champion who can reliably place a [Sleep] debuff. This is mandatory to disable the boss's debuff immunity and high damage reduction.
*   **Damage:** Once the boss is asleep, apply debuffs and use high-damage champions. Damage based on Enemy MAX HP (from skills, HP Burn, or Poison) is highly effective.
*   **Survivability:** The boss deals significant AoE damage that ignores defenses. A reviver is highly recommended to keep your team alive.
