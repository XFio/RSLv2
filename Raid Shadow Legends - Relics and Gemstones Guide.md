### **1. Core Mechanics**

#### **Relics Guide**
Relics are equippable items that grant Champions specific stat boosts and unique abilities. Each Relic’s bonuses and abilities are fixed but can be upgraded to increase their effectiveness.

*   **Stat Bonuses:** Relics can enhance HP, ATK, DEF, SPD, C.DMG, RES, and ACC.
*   **Relic Groups:** Relics are categorized by how their crafting materials are obtained:
    *   **Standard:** Crafted using any materials.
    *   **Chimera:** Crafted using materials from Chimera Battles.
    *   **Event:** Crafted using materials from time-limited Events.
    *   **Clan:** Crafted using materials from the Clan Shop.
    *   **Live Arena:** Crafted using materials from the Live Arena.
    *   **Faction Wars:** Crafted using materials from Faction Wars.
*   **Rarity and Rank:** Rarity determines the number of sockets, starting Rank, and ability strength.
    *   **Rare:** 1 socket, starts at Rank 1.
    *   **Epic:** 2 sockets, starts at Rank 2.
    *   **Legendary:** 3 sockets, starts at Rank 3.
    *   **Mythical:** 4 sockets, starts at Rank 4.
*   **Upgrades and Leveling:**
    *   A Relic's Rank (1-6) determines its max level.
    *   To upgrade Rank, a Relic must be at its current max level and requires sacrificing other Relics or Basalt of the same Rank.
    *   A Relic's Level (0-18) is increased using Starstones.
    *   Stat bonuses increase with each level. New stats are unlocked at Levels 9 and 15.
    *   The unique ability gets stronger at Levels 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18.

#### **Gemstones Guide**
Gemstones are inserted into Relic sockets to grant additional passive abilities.

*   **Sockets:** Relics have fixed sockets (Circular, Diamond, Pentagonal, Square, Triangular). Gemstones must match the socket shape.
*   **Rarity:** Gemstones come in Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Mythical rarities, which determine the strength of their ability. A Gemstone of any rarity can be placed in a Relic of any rarity.

*   **S Tier:** Very strong relics which significantly boost champion performance.
*   **A Tier:** Strong relics which make a noticeable difference to champion performance.
*   **B Tier:** Decent relics which are good filler options for champions.
