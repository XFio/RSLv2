# Raid Shadow Legends - Iron Twins Fortress Dungeon Guide

## Overview

The Iron Twins Fortress is a daily dungeon in Raid Shadow Legends featuring the Iron Twins boss. The dungeon resets every day, and the boss's affinity (Magic, Spirit, Force, or Void) changes daily. The fight is a race against time, as the boss grows stronger the longer the battle continues. The central mechanic revolves around managing the `[Ironbrand]` debuff.

### Active Skills

*   **Voltaic Pendulums:**
    *   Attacks one enemy, placing a 30% `[Decrease C. RATE]` debuff for 4 turns.
    *   If the target already has `[Decrease C. RATE]`, it also places a 25% `[Weaken]` debuff for 4 turns.
    *   After the initial hit, attacks all other enemies.
    *   Places a 50% `[Decrease ATK]` debuff for 4 turns on all other enemies.
    *   If an enemy already has `[Decrease ATK]`, it also places a 60% `[Decrease DEF]` debuff for 4 turns.
    *   This skill will ignore `[Unkillable]` buffs when the boss's HP is at or below 40%.

*   **Fires of Insanity (Cooldown: 3 turns):**
    *   Attacks all enemies.
    *   Places or extends `[Ironbrand]` debuffs on all enemies.
    *   The duration of the `[Ironbrand]` debuff is based on each champion's DEF stat (higher DEF receives a longer duration).

*   **Ruinous Swath:**
    *   Attacks all enemies.
    *   Places or extends `[Ironbrand]` debuffs on all enemies.
    *   The duration of the `[Ironbrand]` debuff is based on each champion's ATK stat (higher ATK receives a longer duration).

### Passive Skills & Core Mechanics

*   **Doomsday Machine [Passive]:**
    *   Attacks all enemies 2 times.
    *   **First Hit:** Places/extends `[Ironbrand]` based on each champion's DEF.
    *   **Second Hit:** Places/extends `[Ironbrand]` based on each champion's ATK.
    *   **Third Hit:** Attacks all enemies again. This hit's damage increases based on the duration of the `[Ironbrand]` debuff on each champion. This hit also ignores 30% of the target's DEF.

*   **Retaliatory Launch [Passive]:**
    *   When the boss's HP drops below 80%, 60%, and 40%, it instantly attacks all enemies and removes all debuffs from itself.
    *   The boss fills its Turn Meter by 10% whenever an enemy receives a buff. This effect is blocked if the boss is under a `[Decrease SPD]` debuff.
    *   The boss takes 50% less damage from each subsequent hit of multi-hit skills.
    *   The boss is immune to Turn Meter reduction effects.

*   **Almighty Immunity [Passive]:**
    *   Immune to: `[Stun]`, `[Freeze]`, `[Sleep]`, `[Provoke]`, `[Block Cooldown Skills]`, `[Fear]`, `[True Fear]`.
    *   Immune to: HP exchange, HP balancing, and cooldown increasing effects.

*   **Almighty Strength [Passive]:**
    *   Damage from skills based on enemy MAX HP is capped at 10% of the boss's MAX HP.
    *   Poison effects are 90% less effective.

*   **[Ironbrand] Debuff:**
    *   This debuff has no direct effect on its own.
    *   It significantly increases the damage dealt by the boss's **Doomsday Machine** skill. The longer the duration of the `[Ironbrand]` debuff, the more damage that skill will do.
    *   It cannot be blocked or removed, but it can be resisted.

*   **[Growth Effect] Mechanic:**
    *   Every time the boss uses **Fires of Insanity** or **Ruinous Swath**, its DEF increases by 2.5%.
    *   This DEF increase is boosted by an additional 1% for every enemy champion whose Affinity is different from the boss's current Affinity.
    *   This effect stops once the boss's HP is below 40%.

## Strategy Guide: How to Beat the Iron Twins

*   **Manage `[Ironbrand]`:** This is the most critical part of the fight. The `[Ironbrand]` debuff makes the **Doomsday Machine** skill lethal. High Resistance on your champions is a primary way to mitigate this.
*   **Affinity Matching:** Bringing champions with an Affinity that is weak or neutral to the boss is better than bringing strong-affinity champions. The boss gains extra stats (`[Growth Effect]`) for each champion of a different affinity, making it stronger faster if you bring a full counter-affinity team.
*   **Damage Type:** Prioritize champions with high, single-hit damage. The boss has a passive that significantly reduces damage from multi-hit skills.
*   **Buffs and Debuffs:**
    *   Be cautious with team buffs, as each one fills the boss's Turn Meter by 10%.
    *   A `[Decrease SPD]` debuff is essential as it negates the Turn Meter fill from your buffs.
    *   `[HP Burn]` debuffs are still useful for damage, even though their effectiveness is reduced.
*   **HP Thresholds:** Be prepared for the boss's powerful retaliatory attack and self-cleanse when its HP drops below 80%, 60%, and 40%. Plan your healing and defensive cooldowns around these thresholds.
