#### **3. Boss Skills & Mechanics (Akumori the Phantom Shogun)**

**Core Mechanic: The Shade Counter**
The entire fight revolves around managing the **Shade counter**. It increases Akumori's power significantly and is reduced by using Awakened champions.

**Active Skills:**

*   **Spectral Lunge:** Attacks 1 enemy, prioritizing targets with an [Enfeeble] debuff. Then, attacks all other enemies under an [Enfeeble] debuff. Each hit fills Akumoriâ€™s Turn Meter by 20%.
*   **Scourge Sword:** Attacks 1 enemy, prioritizing targets with an [Enfeeble] debuff. After attacking, removes all buffs from all enemies (except the initial target). It then spreads the [Enfeeble] debuff from the initial target to all other enemies and places a 60% [Decrease DEF] debuff on them for 2 turns. If no enemies are under [Enfeeble] after this, it places an unremovable, irresistible [Enfeeble] debuff on the enemy with the highest Critical Damage for 3 turns.
*   **Forest of Spears:** Attacks the enemy with the highest C. DMG, prioritizing those not under a [Stone Skin] buff. Before attacking, places an unremovable, irresistible [Block Passive Skills] debuff on all enemies for 3 turns. After attacking, places an unremovable, irresistible [Enfeeble] debuff on the target for 3 turns.
*   **Wraith Javelin:** Attacks 1 enemy, prioritizing targets with an [Enfeeble] debuff. This attack gains power based on the Shade counter:
    *   **10+ stacks:** Ignores [Block Damage] buffs.
    *   **20+ stacks:** Also ignores [Unkillable] buffs.
    *   **30+ stacks:** Also ignores [Ally Protection] buffs.
    *   **40+ stacks:** Also ignores [Shield] buffs.

**Passive Skills:**

*   **Shroud of the Shogun (Passive):**
    *   **Increases Shade Counter:**
        *   +2/4/6 stacks (Stages 1-10/11-20/21-25) when an enemy lands a weak hit on Akumori.
        *   +5 stacks when Akumori lands a critical hit.
        *   +2 stacks when an [Enfeeble] debuff is removed, transferred, or expires on an enemy.
    *   **Effects of Shade Counter:**
        *   Each stack increases Akumori's C.RATE by 1% and C.DMG by 2%.
        *   **20+ stacks:** Immune to damage from [Poison].
        *   **30+ stacks:** Also immune to damage from [HP Burn] and [Smite].
        *   **40+ stacks:** Also immune to damage from skills based on Akumori's MAX HP.
        *   **50+ stacks:** All attacks ignore 100% of the target's DEF.
    *   **Additional Effect:** When Akumori kills an enemy, he attacks all enemies.
    *   **Immunity:** Immune to Turn Meter reduction and [Enfeeble] debuffs.

*   **Purge The Shadow (Passive):**
    *   **Decreases Shade Counter:** Using a skill against Akumori with an **Awakened Champion** reduces the Shade counter. The reduction depends on the champion's Awakening Level and the hit number of the skill.
        *   **Level 6 Awakening:** -6 stacks (1st hit), -3 (2nd hit), -1 (3rd hit).
        *   **Level 5 Awakening:** -5 stacks (1st hit), -2 (2nd hit), -1 (3rd hit).
        *   **Level 4 Awakening:** -4 stacks (1st hit), -2 (2nd hit), -1 (3rd hit).
        *   **Level 3 Awakening:** -3 stacks (1st hit), -1 (2nd hit).
        *   **Level 2 Awakening:** -2 stacks (1st hit), -1 (2nd hit).
        *   **Level 1 Awakening:** -1 stack (1st hit).

*   **Almighty Immunity (Passive):** Immune to Stun, Freeze, Sleep, Provoke, Block Skills, Fear, True Fear, Petrification, HP exchange/balancing, and cooldown increasing effects.

*   **Almighty Strength (Passive):** Damage from enemy MAX HP skills is capped at 10% of the boss's MAX HP.

*   **Awakened Weakness (Passive):**
    *   Boss deals less damage to champions based on their Awakening Level (up to 25% reduction).
    *   Boss takes more damage from champions based on their Awakening Level (up to 50% increase).

#### **4. Strategy to Defeat Akumori**

1.  **Manage the Shade Counter:** This is the primary objective.
    *   **Use Awakened Champions:** This is the *only* way to decrease the Shade counter. Multi-hit skills on high-awakened champions are most effective.
    *   **Avoid Weak Hits:** Weak hits dramatically increase the counter. Use champions of the correct affinity or equip the **Affinitybreaker Artifact Set**, which gives a 50% chance to turn a weak hit into a critical hit.

2.  **Control the [Enfeeble] Debuff:**
    *   The initial [Enfeeble] placed by `Forest of Spears` and `Scourge Sword` is unremovable.
    *   However, the [Enfeeble] debuffs that are *spread* by `Scourge Sword` **can be cleansed, blocked, and resisted**. Bring a champion with cleansing or block debuff skills.

3.  **Use [Taunt] Buffs:** A champion with a [Taunt] buff can direct Akumori's single-target attacks away from your primary damage dealer or a champion already under an unremovable [Enfeeble], preventing the debuff from spreading.

4.  **Bring Survivability Debuffs:** Akumori hits very hard, especially as the Shade counter rises. Champions who can place **[Decrease ATK]**, **[Decrease C.RATE]**, and **[Decrease C.DMG]** are essential.

5.  **Champion Selection:**
    *   **Do NOT rely on Passive Skills:** Akumori's `Forest of Spears` skill places an unblockable [Block Passive Skills] debuff on your entire team.
    *   **Prioritize Awakened Champions:** Their ability to reduce the Shade counter and their inherent damage bonuses are critical for this fight.
