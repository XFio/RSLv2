## **Raid Shadow Legends - Fire Knight Dungeon Guide**

### **1. General Overview**

The Fire Knight's Castle is a dungeon in Raid Shadow Legends. The boss is named Fyro. The dungeon has two difficulties: Normal (featuring Fyro) and Hard (featuring Tainted Fyro). Hard mode can drop Mythical rarity artifacts.

The primary mechanic of the Fire Knight is his **Divine Shield**.
- The shield reduces incoming damage by 80% and makes the boss immune to all debuffs.
- It must be broken by a specific number of hits before damage and debuffs can be applied.
- If the boss takes a turn while the shield is active, he heals himself and performs a powerful AoE attack that also decreases the MAX HP of all champions.
- The shield regenerates at the start of each of his turns.

**Shield Hit Counts (Normal Mode - Fyro):**
- **Stages 1-6:** 5 hits
- **Stages 7-9:** 7 hits
- **Stages 10-20:** 10 hits
- **Stages 21-25:** 12 hits

**Artifact Sets Farmable in Fire Knight's Castle:**
Fury, Curing, Immunity, Shield, Critical Damage, Frenzy, Regeneration, Stun, Savage.

### **2. Normal Mode Boss: Fyro**

**Fyro's Skills:**
*   **Searing Storm:** Attacks all enemies. Decreases enemy MAX HP by 15% of damage dealt.
*   **Dazzling Flames (Cooldown: 5 turns):** Attacks all enemies. Places a 30% [Decrease SPD] debuff for 3 turns.
*   **Cloak of Fire [Passive]:** Manages the Divine Shield mechanic described above.
*   **Almighty Immunity [Passive]:** Immune to Stun, Freeze, Sleep, Provoke, Block Skills, Fear, and True Fear. Also immune to HP exchange/balance effects and cooldown increasing effects.
*   **Almighty Strength [Passive] (Stages 21+):** Damage from skills based on enemy MAX HP is capped at 10% of the boss's MAX HP.
*   **Almighty Persistence [Passive] (Stages 21+):** All Turn Meter reduction effects are 50% less effective.

**Strategy for Defeating Fyro:**
A successful team composition generally requires:
1.  **Multi-Hit Champions:** At least 3 champions with multi-hit attacks on their default (A1) skill to break the shield.
2.  **Turn Meter Control:** A champion who can decrease the boss's Turn Meter to prevent him from taking turns and regenerating his shield.
3.  **Speed Control:** A champion who can apply a [Decrease SPD] debuff on the boss and/or an [Increase SPD] buff on your team.
4.  **Counterattack / Reflect Damage:** These buffs are highly effective as they generate extra hits to break the shield faster.
5.  **Wave Control:** Champions with AoE crowd control skills (like Stun, Sleep, Freeze) to manage the two waves of minions before the boss.

**Fyro's Affinity by Stage:**
*   **Force (Red):** Stages 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 20, 24
*   **Spirit (Green):** Stages 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 21, 25
*   **Magic (Blue):** Stages 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 22

### **3. Hard Mode Boss: Tainted Fyro**

**Tainted Fyro's Skills:**
*   **Crushing Firestrike:** Attacks all enemies. Destroys enemy MAX HP by 15% of damage dealt, ignoring [Shield] buffs.
*   **Corrupting Blaze:** Attacks all enemies. Places a 30% [Decrease SPD] and a 60% [Decrease DEF] debuff for 3 turns. Also destroys enemy MAX HP by 15% of damage dealt.
*   **Bloodflame Cloak [Passive]:** The Hard Mode version of the Divine Shield. It functions similarly but has an added penalty: when attacked while the shield is active, it destroys the attacker's MAX HP by 1% per hit.
*   **Quell the Flames [Passive]:** Instantly removes any [Freeze] debuffs placed on him. For each [Freeze] debuff removed this way, his Turn Meter is decreased by 15%.
*   **Tainted Immunity [Passive]:** Immune to Stun, Sleep, Provoke, Block Skills, Fear, True Fear, and Petrification. Also immune to HP exchange/balance, Turn Meter reduction, and cooldown increasing effects.
*   **Almighty Strength [Passive]:** Damage from skills based on enemy MAX HP is capped at 10% of the boss's MAX HP.
*   **Awakened Weakness [Passive]:** Interacts with Champion Awakening levels. The boss deals less damage to and takes more damage from champions with higher Awakening levels.

**Strategy for Defeating Tainted Fyro:**
Tainted Fyro requires a more specialized strategy due to his immunity to standard Turn Meter reduction and his MAX HP destruction.

**Key Mechanics & Champion Roles:**
1.  **Multi-Hit Attacks:** Still essential for breaking the shield. Counterattack and Reflect Damage buffs remain very valuable.
2.  **Turn Meter Control via Freeze:** Since direct Turn Meter reduction is blocked, the primary strategy is to use champions who can place [Freeze] debuffs. Tainted Fyro will instantly cleanse the Freeze, but his Turn Meter will be reduced by 15% for each one, effectively controlling his turns.
3.  **Essential Debuffs (Post-Shield):** Once the shield is down, apply [Heal Reduction], [Weaken], and [Decrease DEF] to maximize damage and prevent healing.
4.  **MAX HP Restoration:** All of Tainted Fyro's attacks destroy MAX HP. Champions or Blessings (like Miracle Heal) that can restore destroyed MAX HP are crucial for survival.

**Two Common Approaches:**
*   **Fast Teams:** Use Turn Meter boosting champions to get many turns quickly, break the shield, and then control the boss's Turn Meter with repeated [Freeze] applications.
*   **Slow / Counterattack Teams:** Rely on [Counterattack] and [Reflect Damage] buffs. Let the boss attack your team, and use the resulting counterattacks to break the shield. Once the shield is down, apply debuffs and control with [Freeze].
