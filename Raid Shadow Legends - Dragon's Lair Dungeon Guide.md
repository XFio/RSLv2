## Raid Shadow Legends - Dragon's Lair Dungeon Guide

### Overview

The Dragon's Lair dungeon features the boss Hellrazor. The dungeon has two difficulties: Normal (Hellrazor) and Hard (Tainted Hellrazor). The Hard mode version has a chance to drop Mythical rarity artifacts.

The Dragon boss is immune to Decrease Turn Meter and Decrease Speed effects, so you cannot slow him down. The primary strategy is to speed up your own team to take more turns.

The boss's main attacks inflict **Decrease Attack**, **Poison**, and **Weaken** debuffs. A key mechanic is the "purple bar" phase, where you must deal a certain amount of damage to the boss to prevent a powerful follow-up attack that stuns your entire team. A support champion who can remove debuffs or provide healing is crucial for survival.

### Normal Mode: Hellrazor

#### Hellrazor: Skills

*   **Swipe [ATK]:** Attacks all enemies. Places a 50% [Decrease ATK] debuff for 2 turns.
*   **Wall of Fire [ATK] (Cooldown: 3 turns):** Attacks all enemies. Places two 5% [Poison] debuffs for 3 turns and a 25% [Weaken] debuff for 2 turns.
*   **Inhale (Cooldown: 3 turns):** Fully depletes the dragon’s Turn Meter and unlocks the secret skill, Scorch. This activates the Dragon's purple health bar. You must deplete this purple bar before his next turn to prevent him from using Scorch.
*   **Scorch [ATK]:** Attacks all enemies. Places a [Stun] debuff for 1 turn. This skill is locked again if the Dragon takes enough damage while it is unlocked.
*   **Almighty Immunity [Passive]:** Immune to [Stun], [Freeze], [Sleep], [Provoke], [Block Active Skills], [Fear], and [True Fear] debuffs. Also immune to HP exchange/balancing effects and cooldown increasing effects.
*   **Almighty Strength [Passive] (Stages 21-25):** Damage from skills that scale based on enemy MAX HP cannot exceed 10% of the Boss’s MAX HP.
*   **Almighty Persistence [Passive] (Stages 21-25):** All Turn Meter reduction effects are decreased by 50% when used against the Boss.

#### Hellrazor: Strategy Guide

*   **Damage Mitigation:** Apply a [Decrease Attack] debuff to reduce the damage from the boss's attacks.
*   **Debuff Management:** Bring a champion who can apply [Block Debuffs] before the Dragon attacks or a champion who can [Remove Debuffs] to cleanse the Poisons and Weaken. High Resistance (e.g., 300+ for Stage 20) on your support champion is recommended.
*   **Handling the "Inhale" Mechanic:** You must have strong damage dealers (nukers) to clear the purple HP bar quickly and prevent the "Scorch" stun attack.
*   **Survival:** If your team is dying, include a champion with a [Revive] skill or one who can provide [Ally Protection].
*   **Improving Run Speed:** To achieve faster runs (under 2 minutes), speed tune your team. The ideal order is:
    1.  [Increase Attack] buffer
    2.  [Decrease Defense] debuffer
    3.  Nuker/Damage Dealer

### Hard Mode: Tainted Hellrazor

#### Tainted Hellrazor: Skills

*   **Withering Swipe [ATK]:** Attacks all enemies. Places a 50% [Decrease ATK] debuff for 2 turns.
*   **Mephitic Fire [ATK]:** Attacks all enemies. Places four 5% [Poison] debuffs for 3 turns and a 25% [Weaken] debuff for 2 turns. Also places a 50% [Increase ATK] buff on himself for 2 turns.
*   **Draconic Gaze:** Fully depletes the Turn Meters of all enemies. Unlocks the secret skill, Toxic Incineration.
*   **Toxic Incineration [Enemy MAX HP]:** Attacks all enemies, dealing pure damage. Places a [Stun] debuff for 1 turn that cannot be resisted. Instantly activates any 5% [Poison] debuffs on each target. The skill is locked again if Tainted Hellrazor takes enough damage while it is unlocked.
*   **Tainted Immunity [Passive]:** Immune to Stun, Freeze, Sleep, Provoke, Block Active Skills, Fear, True Fear, and Petrification debuffs. Also immune to HP exchange/balancing effects and cooldown increasing effects.
*   **Almighty Strength [Passive]:** Damage from skills that scale based on Enemy MAX HP cannot exceed 10% of the Boss’s MAX HP.
*   **Awakened Weakness [Passive]:**
    *   Decreases the damage the boss inflicts based on the target Champion's Awakening Level (up to 25%).
    *   Increases the damage the boss receives based on the attacking Champion's Awakening Level (up to 50%).

#### Tainted Hellrazor: Strategy Guide

*   **Core Debuffs:** You still need to apply [Decrease DEF], [Weaken], and [Decrease ATK] debuffs.
*   **Handling "Draconic Gaze":** This skill is extremely dangerous. It empties your team's Turn Meters and sets up the unresistable "Toxic Incineration" stun and poison activation. This effectively gives the boss two turns in a row.
*   **Countering "Toxic Incineration":** Just like in Normal mode, when the boss uses Draconic Gaze, a purple HP bar appears. You must deal enough damage to clear this bar before his next turn. Strong nukers and Turn Meter boosting for your own team are essential.
*   **Survival:** Use champions that provide [Increase DEF] and [Shield] buffs. Artifact sets like Bolster and Defiant are also effective at mitigating AoE damage.
*   **Critical Debuff Control:** A cleanser or a [Block Debuffs] champion is mandatory to handle the large number of poison debuffs. Failure to manage these debuffs will result in massive damage when "Toxic Incineration" is used.
