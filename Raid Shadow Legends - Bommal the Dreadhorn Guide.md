#### **2. Bommal the Dreadhorn's Skills**

*   **A1 Ruinous Crush:** (AoE) Attacks all enemies. Decreases the countdown on all **Bomb** debuffs by 1 turn. Instantly activates **HP Burn** debuffs.
*   **A2 Magma Flood:** (AoE, 3-turn CD) Attacks all enemies and places an **HP Burn** debuff for 3 turns.
    *   *Passive Effect:* Enemies take 100% more damage from HP Burn for each Bomb debuff they have.
*   **A3 Rain of Bombs:** (AoE, 3-turn CD) **Removes all buffs** from all enemies, then attacks them. Places an unblockable/unremovable **Bomb** debuff (2-turn countdown). Places one additional Bomb for each buff removed.
*   **A4 Dread Minions:** (5-turn CD) Places an unremovable 50% **Increase ATK** buff on himself, summons two **Dreadbombs**, and gains an Extra Turn.
    *   *Passive Effect:* Summons one Dreadbomb every time his Turn Meter is decreased.
*   **Pressure Wave (Passive):**
    *   When an enemy places a debuff on Bommal, he places an unblockable/unremovable **Bomb** on that enemy.
    *   When a Bomb detonates on an enemy, there is a 25% chance to **Stun** all other enemies for 1 turn.
    *   **CRITICAL WEAKNESS:** Bommal receives **300% more damage** from Bomb debuffs.
*   **Almighty Immunity (Passive):** Immune to standard crowd control (Stun, Freeze, Sleep, etc.), HP swap/balance, and cooldown increases.
*   **Almighty Strength (Passive):** Damage from enemy MAX HP skills is capped at 10% of his MAX HP.
*   **Almighty Persistence (Passive):** All Turn Meter reduction effects are 50% less effective against him.

#### **3. Dreadbomb (Minion) Skills**

*   **Detonation (Passive):** At the start of its turn, the Dreadbomb explodes.
    *   Deals pure damage equal to **40% of each enemy's MAX HP**. This damage ignores [Shield] buffs.
    *   If the Dreadbomb is under a **[Freeze]** debuff, the damage is reduced to **20% of each enemy's MAX HP**.
*   **Short Fuse (Passive):** Immune to all damage, debuffs, and effects **EXCEPT [Freeze] and [HP Burn]**. Cannot be killed by direct attacks.

#### **4. Core Strategy & Mechanics**

**A. What to AVOID:**

*   **Turn Meter Reduction:** This is the most critical rule. Using any Turn Meter reduction skill (or the Evil Eye mastery) will trigger his passive, causing him to summon more Dreadbombs and quickly overwhelm your team.
*   **Excessive Buffs:** His A3 skill, `Rain of Bombs`, strips all buffs and places an additional Bomb for each one removed. Using many buffs will result in massive incoming damage.
*   **Debuffing Bommal (Carelessly):** His `Pressure Wave` passive punishes any champion that places a debuff on him by applying a Bomb to them.
*   **Relying on Defense:** Both Bombs and Dreadbomb explosions deal damage that ignores the Defense stat. Prioritize high HP pools for survival.
*   **Debuff Cleansing for Bombs:** His Bombs **cannot be removed** by any cleanse or debuff removal skill.

**B. Recommended Strategies & Champion Roles:**

*   **Damage Sources:**
    *   **Poisons:** A reliable way to deal consistent damage over a long fight.
    *   **HP Burn:** Effective, especially with his A2 passive, but requires careful management.
    *   **Bombs:** Highly effective due to his passive weakness (takes 300% more damage from Bombs).
*   **Minion Control:**
    *   The *only* way to mitigate Dreadbomb damage is to apply a **[Freeze]** debuff to them before they detonate. This halves their damage.
*   **Survivability:**
    *   **High HP & Healing:** Build champions with 60k+ HP. Bring strong healers and revivers.
    *   **Decrease Attack:** Essential for reducing Bommal's direct damage.
    *   **High Resistance:** To resist his HP Burn debuff and buff strip.
    *   **Decrease Accuracy:** Applying this debuff to Bommal significantly lowers the Resistance your champions need, making gearing much easier.
    *   **Block Debuffs:** Crucial for preventing the Stun debuffs that occur when Bombs detonate.
*   **Niche Gear:**
    *   **Deflection Set:** Can be used on a low-resistance champion to reflect Bombs back onto the boss.
