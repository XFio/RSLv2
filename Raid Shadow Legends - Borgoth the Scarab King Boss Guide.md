### **Raid Shadow Legends - Borgoth the Scarab King Boss Guide**

#### **I. Overview**

**Borgoth the Scarab King** is a boss in the Doom Tower (Rotations 1 and 3) in Raid: Shadow Legends.

**Core Mechanics:**
1.  **Counterattack:** The boss counterattacks any champion who attacks it without a `Shield` buff.
2.  **Buff Stealing:** The boss can steal buffs from champions. The number of hits it performs is based on the number of buffs a champion has.
3.  **Damage Reduction Shield:** The boss has a powerful passive shield that significantly reduces incoming damage. This shield's effectiveness is reduced as the boss's MAX HP is lowered.
4.  **Weakness:** The damage reduction shield can be bypassed by using champions with `Decrease MAX HP` skills or by equipping champions in a `Destroy` artifact set.

**B. Core Strategies to Defeat Scarab King:**

1.  **Maintain a Shield Buff:**
    *   **Why:** This is the most critical mechanic. It prevents the boss's counterattacks and mitigates the severity of its buff steal/removal skill.
    *   **How:** Use champions with AoE `Shield` skills, ensuring they are fast enough to apply the shield before your other champions take their turns. Alternatively, use **Bloodshield** accessories, which generate a shield based on the damage the wearer deals.
    *   **Recommended Champions:** Metalshaper, Lodric Falconheart, Miscreated Monster, Toragi the Frog, Valkyrie, Sigmund the Highshield.

2.  **Break the Damage Reduction Shield (Decrease MAX HP / Destroy Set):**
    *   **Why:** The boss takes 90% less damage until its MAX HP is reduced. This is the primary way to make the boss vulnerable.
    *   **How:** Equip your damage dealers in a **Destroy** artifact set or use champions with `Decrease MAX HP` skills.
    *   **Recommended Champions:** Outrider, Dark Elhain, Scrapper, Vergis (in Destroy set).

3.  **Utilize Turn Meter Reduction:**
    *   **Why:** Preventing the boss from taking turns is a highly effective strategy.
    *   **How:** Use champions with strong turn meter reduction skills. They must be faster than the boss (150 SPD on Normal, 225 SPD on Hard).
    *   **Recommended Champions:** Alure, Armiger.

4.  **Use Poison for Damage:**
    *   **Why:** Poison deals damage based on the enemy's MAX HP, which can be effective.
    *   **How:** Apply multiple stacks of `Poison`.
    *   **Important Note:** This strategy has anti-synergy with the `Decrease MAX HP` strategy. As the boss's MAX HP decreases, poison ticks will do less damage. Choose one primary damage approach.
    *   **Recommended Champions:** Urost the Soulcage, Bad-el-Kazar, Aox the Rememberer.

5.  **Focus on Survivability and Healing:**
    *   **Why:** The fight can be long, and Lifesteal gear is ineffective at the start due to the boss's high damage reduction.
    *   **How:** Use **Immortal** and **Regeneration** artifact sets for passive healing. Champions with strong self-sustain or team healing passives are also excellent.
    *   **Recommended Champions:** Vergis, Vrask, Valla, Scyl of the Drakes, Urost the Soulcage.
