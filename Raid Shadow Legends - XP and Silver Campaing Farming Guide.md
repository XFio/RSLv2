### **Raid Shadow Legends - XP and Silver Campaing Farming Guide**

This guide provides the essential, future-proof principles for efficiently farming Experience (XP) and Silver in the Campaign.

#### **Part 1: The Core XP Farming Strategy**

The foundation of fast leveling is understanding how XP is awarded. Each Campaign stage gives a fixed amount of total XP, which is divided equally among all champions in your team.

*   **The "Wasted XP" Rule:** A champion at their maximum level (e.g., Level 60) cannot gain more XP. Their share is lost.
*   **The Optimal Method:** To level up "food" champions quickly, use one powerful "farmer" champion who can beat the stage alone, alongside 1-3 food champions. This funnels the maximum possible XP into the champions you are trying to level.

**Example:** On a stage that gives 16,000 total XP:
*   1 Farmer + 3 food champions = Each food champion gets **4,000 XP**.
*   1 Farmer + 1 food champion = The food champion gets **8,000 XP**.

#### **Part 2: Where to Farm - Choosing the Right Stage for Your Goal**

The "best" stage depends on your primary goal: balanced efficiency, pure XP gain, or time savings.

**The Best Overall Stage (Balanced Farming): Brutal 12-3**
This remains the community standard for a reason. It offers the best-balanced return on **XP, Silver, and time invested**. For the vast majority of players, this is the most efficient and practical stage to farm.

**The Best Stage for Pure XP (Advanced): Nightmare 12-6**
For players with an exceptionally strong farmer who can clear it quickly, this stage offers the absolute highest **XP-per-energy** ratio in the game. It is the most *energy-efficient* choice for leveling, but it costs more time per run.

**A Note on Time vs. Energy Efficiency**
It is crucial to distinguish between the two.
*   **Brutal (8 Energy):** More **time-efficient**. You can complete runs faster, which is ideal when using a +100% XP Boost that has a time limit.
*   **Nightmare (16 Energy):** More **energy-efficient**. You get more XP for each point of energy spent, which is better if you have limited energy but ample time.

#### **Part 3: Maximizing Your Gains with Boosts**

To accelerate progress, always stack available boosts when farming.

*   **+100% XP Boost:** The most critical item for leveling. It doubles all XP earned from battles.
*   **Raid Card:** A monthly subscription providing a 20% multiplicative boost to Campaign XP and Silver.
*   **Forge Pass:** Can provide up to a 50% additive boost to XP and Silver.

#### **Part 4: Updated Farming Data & Context**

The table below reflects the rewards for the most relevant farming stages in Brutal difficulty.

**Brutal Difficulty - Chapter 12: The Deadlands**

| Stage | Total XP | Total Silver (Approx.) | XP per Energy | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **12-3** | **8,592** | **10,100** | **1,074** | **Best for Balanced Farming** |
| **12-6** | **9,024** | **10,700** | **1,128** | Higher XP, but shields sell for less Silver |
| **12-7 (Boss)**| **14,520** | **10,900** | **1,815** | High XP, but slow and less efficient overall |

**Note on the 2025 Boss Rebalance:** In early 2025, the XP rewards for all boss stages (Stage 7) were significantly increased. While the XP-per-energy for Stage 12-7 now looks very high on paper, the stage takes much longer to complete and is less efficient for overall farming compared to the speed and balanced rewards of Stage 12-3.
