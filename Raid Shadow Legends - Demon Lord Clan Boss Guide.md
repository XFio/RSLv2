## Raid Shadow Legends - Demon Lord Clan Boss Guide

### 1. Overview and Core Mechanics

The Clan Boss is a daily boss in Raid: Shadow Legends that can only be fought by players who are members of a Clan.

*   **Access:** Requires 1 Clan Boss Key per battle. Keys replenish every 6 hours. A key can be purchased for 100 Gems.
*   **Difficulties:** There are 6 difficulty levels, in increasing order:
    1.  Easy
    2.  Normal
    3.  Hard
    4.  Brutal
    5.  Nightmare
    6.  Ultra-Nightmare
*   **Rewards:** Players receive chest rewards based on the total amount of damage dealt to a specific difficulty of the Clan Boss. Damage from multiple keys on the same difficulty can be combined to reach higher reward tiers.

### 2. Common Mistakes to Avoid

1.  **Not Prioritizing Clan Boss:** Neglecting to build a Clan Boss team early results in missing out on valuable daily rewards, including:
    *   **Shards:** Void, Ancient, Sacred
    *   **Skill Tomes:** Rare, Epic, Legendary
    *   **Gear:** Immortal Set (upgraded Life Set) and Cruel Set (upgraded Offense Set)
    *   **Resources:** Gems, Silver, XP Brews, Ascension Potions
2.  **Bad Team Synergy:** Building a team focused only on damage or only on survival is inefficient. A balanced team with essential buffs and debuffs, proper gear, and masteries is crucial for high damage output. It's also important to have champions of different affinities to counter the boss's affinity changes below 50% HP.
3.  **Challenging an Inappropriate Difficulty:** Using keys on a difficulty where you cannot meet the minimum damage threshold for the lowest reward chest is a waste. It is better to fight a lower-difficulty boss where you can earn a top-tier chest than to earn no chest at a higher difficulty.

### 3. Recommended Champion Stats by Difficulty

Sufficient Accuracy (ACC) is required to land debuffs, and high Defense (DEF) and HP are essential for survival.

| Difficulty        | Boss Speed | Required ACC | Required DEF | Required HP |
| ----------------- | :--------: | :----------: | :----------: | :---------: |
| **Ultra-Nightmare** |    190     |     220      |    3,500     |   42,500    |
| **Nightmare**     |    170     |     170      |    3,000     |   35,000    |

### 5. Clan Boss Skills and Affinities

The Demon Lord has a set of common skills and unique skills based on its current affinity (Void, Force, Magic, or Spirit).

*   **Passive - Gathering Fury:** Starting from turn 10, the boss's damage increases each turn. The rate of increase grows significantly at turn 20. Starting from turn 50, all attacks ignore [Block Damage] and [Unkillable] buffs and apply [Block Revive] on killed champions.
*   **Passive - Almighty Immunity:** Immune to a wide range of crowd control and manipulation debuffs, including [Provoke], [Fear], and [Block Active Skills].

#### 5.2. Affinity-Specific Skills

### 6. Team Building Strategy

#### 6.1. Basic Guide (Easy, Normal, Hard)

This approach focuses on foundational strategies for early-game players.

*   **Key Debuffs:** [Decrease ATK], [Decrease DEF], [Weaken], [Poison], [HP Burn].
*   **Key Buffs:** [Increase DEF], [Increase SPD], [Continuous Heal].
*   **Masteries:** The Tier 6 Offense masteries, **Warmaster** or **Giant Slayer**, are essential for dealing significant damage.
*   **Artifact Sets:**
    *   **Primary:** Toxic, Accuracy, Perception, Speed, Life.
    *   **Mid-Game Transition:** Lifesteal Set becomes crucial once champions have Warmaster/Giant Slayer, as the mastery procs will heal them for a large amount.
*   **Example F2P Strategy:** Use champions like Outlaw Monk (Uncommon) in a Toxic Set for poison damage, Diabolist for a speed buff, and Warpriest for healing. A starter champion like Kael is excellent for his own poison debuffs.

#### 6.2. Advanced Guide (Brutal, Nightmare, Ultra-Nightmare)

This approach focuses on survivability to last up to 50 turns against the boss's increasing damage.

*   **Key Skills & Buffs:**
    *   **Essential:** [Decrease ATK], [Decrease DEF], [Weaken].
    *   **Survivability:** [Increase DEF], [Strengthen], [Ally Protection], [Shield].
    *   **Advanced Strategies:** [Block Damage], [Unkillable], [Counter Attack], [Ally Join Attack].
*   **Artifact Sets:**
    *   **Core:** Lifesteal, Stalwart (reduces AoE damage by 30%), Guardian.
    *   **Support:** Speed, Perception, Accuracy, Immortal.
*   **Core Strategy:** The primary goal is to survive as long as possible. This is often achieved through:
    1.  **Lifesteal Teams:** Every champion wears a Lifesteal set and heals themselves via Warmaster/Giant Slayer procs. This replaces the need for a dedicated healer.
    2.  **Leech Teams:** A champion applies a [Leech] debuff to the boss, allowing the entire team to heal when they deal damage, freeing them from needing Lifesteal gear.
    3.  **Unkillable/Block Damage Teams:** Specific champions (e.g., Maneater, Roshcard the Tower) are used to make the team immune to damage for several turns, allowing them to survive to turn 50 regardless of their defensive stats. This requires precise speed tuning.
