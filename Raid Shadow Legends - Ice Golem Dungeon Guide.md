### **Raid Shadow Legends - Ice Golem Dungeon Guide**

#### **1. Overview**

The Ice Golem's Peak is a dungeon in Raid Shadow Legends. The boss, Klyssus, is accompanied by two minions. The core mechanic of the fight involves Klyssus's passive ability, which triggers when his health drops to certain thresholds. This passive revives his minions and, if they are already alive, significantly increases his chance of freezing your champions.

The minions are dangerous, applying Heal Reduction and Decrease Defense debuffs, which makes the team vulnerable to the boss's AoE attacks. It is crucial to manage the minions before focusing on the boss.

There are two difficulties:
*   **Normal:** The boss is named Klyssus.
*   **Hard:** The boss is named Tainted Klyssus. Hard mode offers a chance to drop Mythical rarity artifacts.

#### **2. Farmable Artifacts**

#### **3.2. Klyssus Strategy Guide**

*   **Block Revive Strategy:** Use champions with the [Block Revive] skill to kill the minions, preventing Klyssus from reviving them with his passive. This skill does not require Accuracy.
*   **Damage over Time (DoT) Strategy:** Use [Poison] and [HP Burn] debuffs to damage Klyssus. Damage from these debuffs does not trigger his `Frigid Vengeance` passive, allowing you to safely lower his HP. Avoid dealing large amounts of direct damage to the boss.
*   **Sustain & Control Strategy:** Build a durable team that can outlast the boss. Use champions with strong AoE healing, revives, debuff cleansing, and [Ally Protection]. Control the minions with crowd control skills like [Stun], [Freeze], or [Provoke].
*   **Speed Strategy:** To clear the dungeon faster, bring champions who can apply a [Decrease Defense] debuff on enemies and champions who can apply [Increase Attack], [Increase Defense], or [Increase Speed] buffs on your team.

#### **4.2. Tainted Klyssus Strategy Guide**

*   **Primary Strategy: HP Burn:** This is the key to victory. [HP Burn] deals increased damage to the boss and destroys his minions' MAX HP. Champions like Ninja and Walking Tomb Dreng are highly effective.
*   **Minion Management:**
    *   The [Block Revive] strategy still works.
    *   Alternatively, keep the minions alive but place [HP Burn] on them and extend its duration. This will consistently damage the boss and reduce the minions' MAX HP.
    *   The Brimstone Blessing, which applies a [Smite] debuff, is also very useful for its extra damage and MAX HP destruction.
*   **Survival:**
    *   Protect your team with defensive buffs like [Increase DEF] and [Shield]. Bolster and Defiant artifact sets are recommended.
    *   Applying a [Decrease ATK] debuff on the boss is essential to survive his high damage output.
*   **Damage Amplification:** Use [Decrease DEF] and [Weaken] debuffs on the boss and minions to maximize your team's damage.
