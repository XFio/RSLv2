### **Raid Shadow Legends - Hydra Clan Boss Guide**

#### **1. General Overview**

The Hydra is a Clan Boss in Raid Shadow Legends. Players form a team of 6 champions to fight it. The boss has 4 active heads at any time, with 2 additional heads waiting on the sideline. When a head is decapitated, a new one replaces it. Each head has unique skills. The Hydra Clan Boss resets weekly, and players are given 3 Hydra Keys per week to use.

#### **2. Core Mechanics**

*   **Team Size:** 6 Champions.
*   **Rewards:** Hydra Chest rewards are based on damage milestones. If the clan defeats the Hydra, all members receive double rewards. Rewards also include fragments for the Legendary Champion, Mithrala Lifebane.
*   **Free Regroup:** A feature that allows players to test team compositions without consuming a Hydra Key or locking the champions used. No damage dealt is recorded.
*   **Head Rotation:** The combination of 4 active heads and 2 substitute heads is reshuffled monthly, along with their affinities.
*   **Decapitation:** When a head's HP is depleted, it is decapitated and becomes an "Exposed Neck." This Exposed Neck is inactive for a set number of turns and takes 200% increased damage. Each head has a unique "Decapitation Effect" that triggers when it is defeated.
*   **Regrowth:** When a decapitated head grows back, it gains the "Serpent's Will" buff, reducing its incoming damage by 75%.
*   **Champion Lockout:** The 6 champions used in a Hydra battle cannot be used again until the weekly reset.

#### **3. Common Hydra Head Passive Skills (Applies to all heads)**

*   Damage from skills based on enemy MAX HP is capped at 10% of the head's MAX HP.
*   Damage from a single tick of an HP Burn debuff is capped at 20,000 HP.
*   Damage from reflected damage, Warmaster, or Giant Slayer masteries is capped at 50,000 per attack.
*   **Immunities:** All heads are immune to Stun, Freeze, Sleep, Provoke, Block Active/Passive Skills, Fear, True Fear, and Petrification debuffs.
*   **Other Immunities:** All heads are immune to HP exchange/balancing effects, cooldown increasing effects, and Turn Meter reduction effects.
