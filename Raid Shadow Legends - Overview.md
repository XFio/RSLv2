# Raid Shadow Legends Guide

## Overview

### Champions

* Raid Shadow Legends now features a roster of over 900 champions, each bringing unique skills, roles, and strategic depth to the game. To build a successful team, players must strategically combine champions of different affinities and roles to counter opponents and optimize performance across various game modes.

* **Rarity:** Champions come in six rarities (Mythical, Legendary, Epic, Rare, Uncommon, and Common). Mythical champions are like 2-in-1 Legendary champion combined where they can switch into different forms to cater for different content. Legendary champions are the rarest and often possess the most powerful abilities, while Common champions serve as the foundation for early gameplay and fusion events.

* **Affinity:** The game’s four affinities (Magic, Void, Spirit, and Force) form a rock-paper-scissors system. Magic trumps Spirit, Spirit beats Force, and Force overpowers Magic. Void, being neutral, is versatile but has no specific strengths or weaknesses against other affinities. Choosing the right affinity in battles can make the difference between victory and defeat.

* **Roles:** Champions are categorized into four roles: Attack, Defense, Support, and HP. Attack champions excel at dealing damage, Defense champions absorb damage and protect the team, Support champions provide healing, buffs, and debuffs, and HP champions rely on their health for sustainability and protect their team by mitigating ally damage to themselves.

* **Champion Ascension:** Ascension enhances champions by unlocking new skills, upgrading existing ones, boosting base stats, and opening up accessory slots. For example, ascending a champion like Arbiter not only increases her stats but also unlocks more powerful support abilities, making her indispensable in both PvE and PvP content.

* **Champion Awakening:** This unlocks a champion’s true potential, making them significantly stronger by granting them a stat boost, and allowing them to learn a new champion blessing. To awaken a champion, you can do this in the Soul of Altar using either Perfect Soul or Split Soul. These souls are obtained by summoning them using Soulstones (Mortal, Immortal, Eternal). The champion awakening is only available for Rare, Epic, Legendary, and Mythical champions.

* **Champion Blessings:** are further enhancements exclusive to Awakened champions. You choose a Blessing from a specific Divinity (Light, Dark, War, Chaos, Harmony) to specialize your champion for specific content, like boosting damage or improving survivability. Only one Blessing can be active at a time. Awakening is a must-do before Blessings become available. There are six tiers of awakening and each tier grants either stat boost or upgrading the blessing skill.

* **Faction Unity:** With the introduction of faction leaders, faction unity champion posses an additional Aura that grants benefits similar to normal Aura but benefiting to his/her own faction allies. Apart from that, they also unlock an additional ability for every faction ally in the team up to 3 faction allies.

### PvE Content

* **4 Artifact Dungeon Bosses:** Conquer formidable bosses such as the Fire Knight, Spider, Ice Golem, and Dragon. These bosses guard valuable artifact sets and accessories that are crucial for enhancing your champions’ power and strategy.

* **Hard Mode Dungeons:** For players seeking the ultimate test, Hard Mode Dungeons present more difficult versions of the standard dungeons. They offer higher drop rates for Mythical artifacts, providing the most dedicated players with superior rewards and greater challenges.

* **4 Dungeon Keeps:** Farm potions in the Arcane, Spirit, Force, and Magic Keeps. These potions are crucial for ascending your champions, unlocking or upgrading their skills, enhancing their base stats, and opening accessory slots according to their affinities. This boosts their overall abilities and effectiveness in battle.

Each Faction’s Crypt features 21 challenging stages, including formidable boss battles on Stages 7, 14, and 21, where evolving Crypt Keepers demand adaptive strategies. Crypts open randomly for 24 hours within a 7-day cycle, requiring players to build diverse teams from all Factions to succeed. Armed with 12 daily Crypt Keys per Faction, players can attempt stages without losing keys on defeat, earning Glyphs to enhance Artifacts, crafting materials like Bloodstones and Soulstones, and stars for performance-based rewards.

* **Hydra Clan Boss:** Assemble a team of 6 champions to face off against a fearsome four-headed Hydra. Strike down one head, and another vicious one will rise in its place (with 2 different heads at the bench).

Accessible at Level 33 in the “Clan Bosses” Game Mode, it pits 5 Champions against a metamorphic foe with four Forms: Ultimate, Ram, Lion, and Viper. Each Form has unique skills: Ram targets specific Champions, Lion shreds defenses, and Viper inflicts Poison. The Chimera cycles through these Forms every 5 turns, frequently returning to its powerful Ultimate Form, ensuring tension across the 65-turn fight. With four 28-day Rotations, the Affinity of the Forms changes weekly, keeping strategies dynamic. Players earn Chimera Chests based on individual damage dealt, with double rewards if the Clan defeats the Chimera. Weekly resets (Thursday-Friday UTC) refresh the challenge and provide 2 free Chimera Keys. The “Free Regroup” option allows team adjustments mid-battle without penalty. Collaboration is key, as all Clan Members contribute to depleting the Chimera’s HP pool, unlocking higher difficulties (Easy, Normal, Hard, Brutal, Nightmare, Ultra-Nightmare) permanently for the Clan.
