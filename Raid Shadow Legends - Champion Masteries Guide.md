## **Raid Shadow Legends - Champion Masteries Guide**

This guide provides a structured summary of the Champion Masteries in Raid: Shadow Legends, designed for use as context for an LLM.

### **1. Champion Masteries: Core Concepts**

Champion Masteries are a talent tree system used to customize and enhance champions.

*   **Three Trees:** Masteries are divided into three categories: Offense, Defense, and Support.
*   **Activation:** A champion can activate masteries from a maximum of two of the three trees.
*   **Mastery Points:** A champion can select up to 15 masteries in total.
*   **Acquisition:** Masteries are unlocked using scrolls farmed from the Minotaur's Labyrinth dungeon. Alternatively, a champion's masteries can be fully unlocked for 800 gems, a recommended strategy for a player's first Level 60 champion to accelerate progress.
*   **Resetting:** The first mastery reset for a champion is free; all subsequent resets cost 150 gems.
