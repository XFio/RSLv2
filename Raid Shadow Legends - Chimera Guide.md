# Raid Shadow Legends - Chimera Guide

## 1. Overview of the Chimera Clan Boss

The Chimera is a Clan Boss in Raid Shadow Legends that requires both high damage output and specific strategic approaches. It is a shape-shifting boss with four distinct forms, each presenting unique mechanics and challenges.

### Core Mechanics
*   **Unlock Requirement:** Player Level 33 and membership in a Clan.
*   **Location:** Found on the Clan Bosses Map.
*   **Battle Format:** A team of five champions faces the Chimera for a fixed duration of 65 turns.
*   **Objective:** Survival and maximizing damage output over the 65 turns.

### Forms and Rotation
The Chimera has four forms: one Ultimate Form and three animal-themed forms (Ram, Lion, Viper). The boss cycles through these forms every five turns in a predictable sequence.

*   **Sequence:** Ultimate → Ram → Ultimate → Lion → Ultimate → Viper → Ultimate
*   **Cycle:** This sequence repeats twice, ending in the Ultimate Form for the final turns of the battle.

## 2. Chimera Forms and Unique Abilities

Each of the Chimera's animal forms has a unique, powerful ability that defines the strategy required to counter it.

### Ram Form: Duel
*   **Effect:** The Chimera locks onto a single champion, creating a "Duel."
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   The targeted champion is the sole focus of the Chimera's attacks.
    *   The Chimera gains a 50% damage boost against the dueling champion.
    *   The targeted champion's teammates have their damage output reduced against other enemies.
    *   The Duel effect ignores buffs like Taunt or Veil.
*   **How to Break:** The team must deplete the Chimera's "Duel bar," which is equal to 1% of its maximum HP. The Duel also ends if either the Chimera or the targeted champion is defeated.

### Lion Form: Hunter’s Gaze
*   **Effect:** A debuff that bypasses most defensive abilities.
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   Champions afflicted with Hunter's Gaze cannot mitigate damage using Shields, Veils, or Increased Defense buffs.
    *   It also bypasses Unkillable and Block Damage effects.
    *   Evasion is still possible, but any skill-based damage that lands will not be reduced by defensive buffs.

### Viper Form: Necrosis
*   **Effect:** A stacking debuff that deals damage over time based on the number of defeated champions.
*   **Mechanics:**
    *   When a champion on the player's team dies, all surviving champions receive one stack of Necrosis.
    *   At the start of their turn, each champion takes damage equal to 5% of their maximum HP per stack of Necrosis (e.g., 3 stacks = 15% max HP damage).
    *   Necrosis cannot be resisted, blocked, or removed by standard cleansing abilities.
*   **How to Counter:**
    *   Reviving fallen allies reduces the number of Necrosis stacks.
    *   Applying a Stone Skin buff temporarily removes Necrosis, but it returns after the buff expires.

## 3. Battle Structure and Cycles

### Monthly Affinity Rotations
*   The affinities of the Chimera's forms rotate every month (a 28-day cycle).
*   During a rotation, the Ram, Lion, and Viper forms will all share the same affinity.
*   The Ultimate Form will have a different affinity from the other three.

### Weekly Reset and Keys
*   The Chimera becomes unavailable during a weekly reset period between Thursday and Friday (UTC).
*   After the reset, all players receive two Chimera Keys for the week.
*   A "Free Regroup" option allows players to practice and test team compositions without consuming a key.

## 4. Chimera Trials

Trials are in-battle objectives that provide bonus rewards and also empower the Chimera's Ultimate Form as they are completed.

### Trials Overview
*   Each form (Ram, Lion, Viper) has unique trials.
*   Trials have three difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Hard.
*   Completing trials grants immediate rewards (e.g., crafting materials for Relics) and increases a damage multiplier for the Chimera Clash event.

### Ultimate Form Empowerment from Trials

*   **1-3 Trials:** Ignore [Unkillable] Buffs, ATK +5%

*   **7-9 Trials:** Ignore DEF 25%; C.RATE +5%
