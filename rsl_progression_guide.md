## Universal Progression Tips

### Energy Management
1. **Never let energy cap** (waste of regeneration)
2. **Save for events** when possible
3. **Prioritize 2x speed events**
4. **Use gems for energy during tournaments**

### Shard Management
1. **ONLY pull during 2x events**
2. **Save sacreds for guaranteed events**
3. **Track mercy system** (200 ancients, 12 sacreds)
4. **Never chase specific champions**

### Book Management Priority
```
Legendary Books:
1. Game-changing abilities (revive, unkillable)
2. Cooldown reductions
3. Debuff chance increases
4. Damage multipliers (last priority)

Epic Books:
1. Key clan boss champions
2. Arena speed champions
3. Dungeon carries
4. Faction Wars MVPs
```

### Silver Management
- Keep 10M+ reserve minimum
- Save for artifact enhancement events
- Don't upgrade questionable pieces past +12
- Sell everything below your current standards

### Clan Selection Criteria
1. Killing CB level you can hit
2. Active members (30+ daily)
3. Clan vs Clan participation
4. Discord/communication
5. Similar progression level

## Common Progression Bottlenecks & Solutions

| Bottleneck | Common Cause | Solution |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| **Stuck on Spider** | No AOE HP burn | Build Armiger for TM control |
| **Can't beat Fire Knight** | No multi-hitters | Farm Apothecary/Armiger |
| **Low CB damage** | Poor speed tuning | Use calculator, test thoroughly |
| **Stuck in Silver Arena** | Slow speed lead | Farm better speed gear |
| **No legendary pulls** | Bad RNG | Focus on epic/rare teams |
| **Always out of silver** | Upgrading bad gear | Be more selective |
| **Can't clear waves** | No AOE damage | Build Bellower/Saurus |
| **Too many projects** | Lack of focus | Pick ONE goal at a time |

## F2P vs Spender Differences

### F2P Reality Check
- Expect 6-12 months to UNM
- Faction Wars = 1+ year
- Platinum Arena = extremely difficult
- Focus on farmable champions
- Every book is precious

### Low Spender Optimization ($10-50/month)
- Daily gem pack best value
- Warrior's Circle for energy
- Save for guaranteed champion events
- Energy > Shards for progress

### Time vs Money Trade-offs
| Investment | Time Saved | Best For |
|------------|------------|----------|
| Daily gems | 20% faster progress | Everyone |
| Energy packs | 30% more farming | Events |
| Shard packs | RNG dependent | Gambling |
| Book packs | Specific champion boost | Key upgrades |
