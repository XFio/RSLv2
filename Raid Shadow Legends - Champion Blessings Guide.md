# Raid Shadow Legends - Champion Blessings Guide

## 1. Blessings Overview

Blessings are powerful abilities for champions in Raid Shadow Legends, introduced in Patch 6.00. They become available after a champion is "Awakened" to at least Level 1.

### Key Mechanics:
- **Activation:** Requires a champion to be Awakened. Only available for Rare, Epic, and Legendary Champions.
- **Uniqueness:** Each champion can only have one Blessing active at a time.
- **Divinity:** Blessings belong to one of four Divinities: **Light**, **Dark**, **War**, and **Chaos**. A fifth, **Harmony**, is also detailed.
- **Rarity Rules:**
    - **Rare Champions:** Can only use Rare Blessings.
    - **Epic Champions:** Can use Rare and Epic Blessings.
    - **Legendary Champions:** Can use Rare, Epic, and Legendary Blessings.
- **Levels:** Each Blessing has 6 levels, tied directly to the champion's Awakening Level. A Level 5 Awakened champion automatically gets the Level 5 benefit of their chosen Blessing.
- **Bonus Stats:** If a champion uses a Blessing of a lower rarity (e.g., a Legendary champion using an Epic Blessing), they receive additional stat bonuses.
- **Swapping:** Blessings can be changed. The first swap is free; subsequent swaps cost Gems. Swapping within the same Divinity is cheaper.

### FAQ Summary:
- **Team Blessing:** A blessing that affects the entire team (e.g., Intimidating Presence). Some cannot stack; the higher rarity one takes precedence.
- **High Awakening Blessing:** Blessings that gain significant extra benefits at Awakening Level 5 and above.
- **Mid Awakening Blessing:** Blessings that gain extra benefits at Awakening Level 3 and above.

## 2. Awakening Bonus Stats

Blessings provide bonus stats based on the champion's rarity and Awakening level.
